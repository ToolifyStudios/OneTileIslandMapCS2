# OneTileIslandMapCS2

A (almost) perfectly 1 one tile sized island is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a few miles west of the San Francisco bay lies this square shaped 1 tile island, which will soon have your growing city on it! Experience the ultimate one tile challenge, and also at the start you have access to the ocean as well to make your life easier.

## Manual Installation
1. Go to the following path in a file exploring app (WinRar, Windows File Explorer, etc.):

`C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Maps`

**If the folder does not exist, check to see if you have the [Map Installer Mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/Cities2Modding/MapInstaller/) installed.**

2. Drag and Drop (or just Copy) the following two files into the folder:
   `Flatland.cok` and `Flatland.cok.cid`

**Important: Due to some technical errors, please download the `.cok` and the `.cok.cid` files from Thunderstore, just click on "Manual Install" as that has all the files needed, GitHub is not willing to work today.**
[Click here to visit the Thunderstore download page](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/toolify/Flatland/)

3. You should be done! Hop into the game (with your mods enabled) and create a new game, and then pick the map! Have fun!
